# Pet Adoption Prediction

This project builds a deep learning classifier using Keras to predict whether a pet listed for adoption will find a new home or not. The model is trained on pet metadata such as age, breed, color, health status, vaccination records, and more.

## 🚀 Goal

To accurately classify pets into "adopted" or "not adopted" based on structured data, using a binary classification neural network model.

## 🧠 Model Overview

- Framework: Keras (TensorFlow backend)
- Architecture: 3-layer Dense Neural Network (5000 → 1000 → 500 units)
- Activation: ReLU (hidden layers), Sigmoid (output)
- Loss: Binary Crossentropy
- Optimizer: Adam
- Evaluation Metric: Weighted F1 Score
